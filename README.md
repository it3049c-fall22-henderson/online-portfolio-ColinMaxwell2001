## Self-Reflection:
I had trouble with the staging aspect of the assignment, but now I beleive I know how to successfully stage commits. I have never staged commits before, so this was a good learning experience to practice that. I am not entirely sure if I staged the commits correctly which is why I did not give myself a 20/20. I also had a little trouble setting up Github pages but I was able to figure it out eventually. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
2-3 hours with breaks in between
